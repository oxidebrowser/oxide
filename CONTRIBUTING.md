## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable, latest) — [install via rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **wasm32-unknown-unknown** target
- **FFmpeg** development libraries (for video decode in `oxide-browser`): on macOS `brew install ffmpeg`; on Debian/Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libavfilter-dev libavdevice-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev pkg-config`

```bash
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/niklabh/oxide.git
cd oxide

# Build the browser
cargo build -p oxide-browser

# Build an example guest app
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p hello-oxide

# Run the browser
cargo run -p oxide-browser
```

### Run Tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### Verify Formatting & Lints

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

### Key Crates

| Crate | What it does | When to touch it |
|---|---|---|
| `oxide-browser` | The host runtime — compiles WASM, registers host functions, renders UI | Adding capabilities, fixing sandbox bugs, improving the UI |
| `oxide-sdk` | The guest SDK — safe wrappers around `oxide::*` imports | Exposing new host functions to guest apps |
| `examples/*` | Example guest applications | Demonstrating features, onboarding new contributors |

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. **Name your branch** descriptively: `feat/audio-api`, `fix/memory-leak-canvas`, `docs/sdk-examples`.
3. **Make small, focused commits.** Each commit should compile and pass tests.
4. **Write tests** for new functionality when applicable.
5. **Run the full check suite** before pushing:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

6. **Open a pull request** against `main`.

---

## Coding Guidelines

### Rust Style

- Follow standard Rust idioms and the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).
- Run `cargo fmt` before every commit. The CI will reject unformatted code.
- Zero `clippy` warnings. If a lint is genuinely a false positive, suppress it with `#[allow(...)]` and a comment explaining why.
- Prefer `&str` over `String` in function parameters.
- Prefer returning `Result` or `Option` over panicking.

### Naming Conventions

| Entity | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Host function (in `capabilities.rs`) | `api_<category>_<action>` | `api_canvas_rect`, `api_audio_play` |
| SDK wrapper (in `oxide-sdk/src/lib.rs`) | `<category>_<action>` | `canvas_rect`, `audio_play` |
| FFI import (in SDK) | `_api_<name>` | `_api_canvas_rect` |
| Constants | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `KEY_ENTER`, `MAX_MEMORY_PAGES` |
| Types/Structs | `PascalCase` | `FetchResponse`, `UploadedFile` |

### Documentation

- Every public function in the SDK must have a doc comment (`///`).
- Host functions in `capabilities.rs` should have a brief comment explaining the guest-visible behavior.
- Non-obvious design decisions should be documented inline.

### Security

- **Never expose filesystem, environment, or raw socket access** to guest modules.
- All data crosses the host–guest boundary through `(ptr, len)` pairs in linear memory. Validate lengths before reading.
- New capabilities must be explicitly registered — the sandbox is additive by design.
- When in doubt, open a discussion before implementing.

---

## Adding a Host Function

This is the most common type of contribution. Here's the end-to-end process:

### 1. Register the host function in `capabilities.rs`

```rust
linker.func_wrap("oxide", "api_my_feature", |mut caller: Caller<'_, HostState>, arg: u32| -> u32 {
    // Read from guest memory if needed
    // Perform host-side logic
    // Write results back to guest memory if needed
    0 // return value
})?;
```

### 2. Add the FFI import in `oxide-sdk/src/lib.rs`

```rust
#[link(wasm_import_module = "oxide")]
extern "C" {
    #[link_name = "api_my_feature"]
    fn _api_my_feature(arg: u32) -> u32;
}
```

### 3. Add the safe wrapper in `oxide-sdk/src/lib.rs`

```rust
/// Brief description of what this does.
pub fn my_feature(arg: u32) -> u32 {
    unsafe { _api_my_feature(arg) }
}
```

### 4. Add an example or update an existing one

Show the new API in action in `examples/hello-oxide/src/lib.rs` or create a new example.

### 5. Update documentation

- Add the function to the capability table in `README.md`.
- Update `DOCS.md` if it exists.

---

## Building a Guest App

Guest apps are regular Rust libraries compiled to `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

### Scaffold

```bash
cargo new --lib my-app
cd my-app
```

### `Cargo.toml`

```toml
[package]
name = "my-app"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
oxide-sdk = { path = "../oxide-sdk" }
```

### `src/lib.rs`

```rust
use oxide_sdk::*;

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn start_app() {
    canvas_clear(30, 30, 46, 255);
    canvas_text(20.0, 40.0, 28.0, 255, 255, 255, 255, "Hello, Oxide!");
}
```

### Build and Run

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
# Open the .wasm file in the Oxide browser
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fill out the PR template** (if one exists) or include:
   - **What** — a concise summary of the change
   - **Why** — motivation, linked issue number
   - **How** — implementation approach, trade-offs
   - **Testing** — what you tested and how

2. **Keep PRs focused.** One feature or fix per PR. Large PRs are harder to review and more likely to stall.

3. **CI must pass.** The PR will be checked for:
   - `cargo fmt` — formatting
   - `cargo clippy` — lints
   - `cargo test` — unit and integration tests
   - `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` — SDK compiles for WASM

4. **Request a review.** Tag a maintainer or let the auto-assignment handle it.

5. **Address feedback promptly.** If changes are requested, push follow-up commits (don't force-push during review).

6. **Squash on merge.** We squash-merge to keep history clean. Your commit message will become the merge commit message.
